I thought it was unnecessary to include all of the files that are generated by Visual Studio. Just for ease of access, these are just the .cpp files needed to run programs.

In the event there is data to read, that will be contained in its own file.

These files are from an algorithms and data structures course: Algorithmic Toolbox on Coursera.
