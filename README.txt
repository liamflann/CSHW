C++ PROGRAMS
The following is a list of programs I wrote in my C++ class.

PA1: This program needs to allow us to call commands without attaching a prefix to them. It also needs to calculate and display the average of three numbers: 115, 29, and -15. These three numbers serve as our data. The output we wish to see is the average of 115, 29, and -15. This output should take the form of a real number. 

PA2: This program seeks to calculate and output the possible distance a user can drive based on his input values of his vehicle’s tank capacity and miles per gallon. The capacity and MPG are our program’s data, and it is determined by user input. The output we wish to see is the estimated distance this user can drive. This output should take the form of an integer. Specifically, it should return the next lowest integer (round down). 

PA3: This program calculates the total revenue made by selling seats at four different levels to a football game. The four levels are: Box at $250 a seat, Sideline at $100 per seat, Premium at $50 per seat, and General Admission at $25 per seat. This data is loaded into C++ by opening and reading a file. The output produced is the total revenue and the total number of seats sold. The total number of seats sold should be in integer form, and the total revenue should be to two decimal places. This output is then exported to a text document in the working directory (unless otherwise specified). 

PA4: This program calculates the total number of boxes and containers needed to store a user specified number of cookies. This data is based on fixed numbers: a box can hold 24 cookies, and a container can hold 75 boxes. This program also relies on user inputted values, specifically the number of cookies. The output produced appears on screen. This program outputs: the number of boxes needed to store the cookies, if any; the number of left over cookies, if any; the number of containers needed to store the boxes, if any; and finally the number of extra boxes, if any. 

PA5: This program asks the user for two numbers, where the second number is greater than the first. It then
outputs the following information:
	-all odd numbers between first and second numbers. 
	-sum of all even numbers between first and second numbers.
	-numbers and their squares between 1 and 10.
	-sum of the square of the odd numbers between first and second numbers.
	-all uppercase letters.

PA6: This program asks the user to input a value for the temperature and the wind speed, it then outputs the windchill based on the formula given in the homework problem. According to the Wikipedia article, this formula has exponents in it, so this was noted in the calculation (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chill). This program uses four modules: main function that outputs values, windchill function that calculates windchill based on user input, and two void functions that prompt the user for input. The data this program uses is the user input.

PA7: This program reads a line from user input that has a student's first and last name, their social security number, user ID, and password. It then outputs these lines with the student's name, x's over the student's social security number, their student ID, and then x's over their password.

PA8: This program asks the user to enter the last names of five candidates in an election, and the number of votes received by each candidate. It then outputs the number of votes received, and the percentage of the total votes received by the candidate. It outputs the winner of the election. Data is from user input, and the output is a combination of strings and numbers in table format.

PA9: This program reads a file of students’ names followed by their test scores. Then it outputs the name followed by grade. It also finds the highest test scores, and prints the scores and the student's name.

RUNNING PROGRAMS
For more information on each individual program, see each program's user documentation (.docx ending in PAn where n = 1 to 9), and to see test cases see .docx ending with TDCS.
